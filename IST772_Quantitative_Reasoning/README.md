### Description
The aim of this project was to perform statistical analysis on the vaccination volatility rates in the US between 1980 and 2017 for the five common vaccines: DTP1 - infectious diseases, HepB - Hepatitis B, Pol3 - Polio, Hib3 - Influenza B, MCV1 - Measles. Some of the questions the project answers include whether there was found
to be a credible difference in vaccination reporting proportions between private and public schools, whether the vaccination rates in California were better than the the US rates, whether there was a link between missing one vaccine and missing all the others etc. Some of the stakeholders of this project may include students,
state legislators, healthcare professionals, and researchers.
