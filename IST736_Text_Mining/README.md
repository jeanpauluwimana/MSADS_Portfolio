### Description
The project used multiple datasets obtained from various sources including [Kaggle](htpps://www.kaggle.com). The datasets included party nomination `Acceptance speeches` for the US presidential candidates from both parties (Democrats and Republicans) during the period from 1900 through 2016, as well as `DOW Jones Industrial` average data and some other key economic indicator data such as `Consumer Price Index` and `marginal tax rates` from 1913 to 2016. The aim of the project was to perform a multinomial classification and cluster analysis on the text corpus to identify whether the machine learning models could identify which class or cluster presidential candidates belong to based on their speeches. Additionally the project aimed to explore any other unseen relationships in the speeches along with the topic modeling. The stakeholders include academia, politicians and/or potential presidential candidates.
