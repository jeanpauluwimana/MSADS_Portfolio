### Description
This project used custom data created using [GenerateData](https://www.generatedata.com/). For the purpose of populating and testing the task management database, fictional employees, employee IDs, phone number and email addresses were created. My work colleagues and I did not have a task tracking tool. At times, we did not know who was working what. Thus, this database provided a solution to that problem. The stakeholders of this database application included myself, my work colleagues other internal clients who submitted data requests to my team.
